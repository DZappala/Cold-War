			#TODO: based on the number of trade routes passing through the canal, scale tarrif income by (0.1%) per trade route *Note:(0.1%) is a starting point and needs to be balanced. This should hopefully be balanced so that at some point too many ships passing through the canal will make it un-profitable. Test to see if there is logic involing how much money trade routes make based on the distance between two ports. If that logic exists, then taking a shorter route should be more profitable, and thus the canal should be more profitable up to the point at which the tarrif paid outweights the benefit of the shorter route.
